# i.am.payer
Serverless, anonymous order processing for goods and services 

In order processing prevelent today with fiat currency, the key instrument, is a proof of payment, against which the order is fulfilled. In this paradigm, order fulfilment for an identity/account is contingent on the answer to the question : Is there proof of payment ? Such use of proof of payment, is the reason order processing servers exist. Cryptocurrency payment mechanisms prevalant today continue using this paradigm, with an ugly mashing together of the decentralized blockchain with centralized servers.  Mapping cryptocurrencies to a paradigm developed for fiat, does injustice to the potential that crypto-currencies hold for anonymous, serverless order processing.

The blockchain is already an undisputable and available record of a payment. What is needed to fulfil an order is a valid token. The token, which we call the i.am.payer token, can be generated by the payer using the private key associated with the sending address. The order can now be fulfilled against a valid i.am.payer token. A valid i.am.payer token satisfies two conditions:

    (1) The payment claimed in the token was indeed recorded on the blockchain
    (2) The presentation of the token is occuring for the first time

This mechanism obviates the need for order processing servers, and allows payers to maintain anonymity if they take care to use sender addresses that cannot be associated with them. Uses include anything at all paid for online, including downloads (software, music, videos etc) and event tickets (concerts, movies etc).
